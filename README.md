Mathematics for Artificial Intelligence

This is all the work I have done on the coursework that we have been given to do. It explores the basics and advanced technology of AI and provides us of insight for what is to come. 
One task consisting of a grid game that takes user input and shows the Heuristic and Dijkstra's algorithm for it

Prerequisites:

Software - Anaconda, downloaded from the Conda website to use Python with all the libraries pre-installed
Libraries - numpy, heapq

Installation & Running the Code:

Install Anaconda on your chosen device. Once installed, move the files containing the codes to the folder that stores your python files on Anaconda (usually in the user directory). 
After this you may open the files up in Anaconda and check that all libraries are imported. If everything seems fine you may now proceed to run the code.
